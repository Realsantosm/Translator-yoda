## MarkSeven
---


The reason for naming this App as Translator Yoda, is taken from the Yoda
movie a popular Hollywood movies. 

### DESCRIPTION
This App is a fun App that is used to take an input from the user in the form of text
and translate it in the Yoda Language. There is nothing much here but for learning we have implemented it using API.
It is similar to the previous App I have made with a name Speaking Banana.


- Fun translation API and created another fun translation app in VanillaJS.
- All the features implemented in markSix is also be present in this app.
- The app takes in input and translate the input into the respective `Yoda` language.
- Simple and sweet looking design, it is awesome.
